## no-ssr does not work
no-ssr does not work with this approatch to launch dev-server in advance in dev-server.mjs.
I ran into the following error when I tried.

```

```

I tried this approach in order to get rid of vite from the production build, but it seems to be very hard to use this approach with no-ssr.
